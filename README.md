# comping-takes
A Max for Live device to organise the recording and listening to of different takes in a group

Place device on a group track. When a track inside the group is selected, all other tracks will be muted. With record arm enabled on a track in the group, the selected track will also be the only armed track in the group.

Link multiple devices together by giving them the same name and the groups will work together for multi-mic recording.

While Ableton is recording, all functionality is paused, so that selecting a track in the middle of recording will not ruin the recording.

bug: device functions if live set it loaded even when it's turned off
